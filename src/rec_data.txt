Barry:	(sighs) I gotta say something. She saved my life. I've got to say something. All right, here it goes.
 	(Barry flies back into her house through the almost-closed window and stops in front of a can of Bumble Bee Chunk Light Tuna as Vanessa walks by, stopping right in line with the mascot. He starts to walk away and looks back. Says, "Huh" and turns back around to look at the mascot, then says "Nah" as he dismisses the picture and continues walking.)
 	(Barry resumes flying and lands on a postcard from Coney Island taped to the refrigerator, again in a position where Vanessa doesn't notice him.)
Barry:	What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. (begins debating with himself) I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Come on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? "Ya like jazz?" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Barry:	(to Vanessa:) Um, hi!
 	(Vanessa gasps and drops the dishes)
Barry:	I'm sorry.
Vanessa:	Hah, you're talking.
Barry:	Yes, I know, I know. I'm soâ€“
Vanessa:	You're talking.
Barry:	I know. I'mâ€“ I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Vanessa:	No, it's okay. It's fine. It's just... I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
Barry:	Well, you know, I'm sure this is very disconcerting....
Vanessa:	Yeah! I mean, this is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
Barry:	Yeah.
Vanessa:	Yeah.
Barry:	Yeah, I am a bee. And, uh, you know I'm not supposed to be doing this, but...
 	(Vanessa makes a small "Oh" and "uh-huh" noises while Barry's talking)
Barry:	...they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I mean, I had to thank you. It's, it's just the way I was raised.
 	(Vanessa grabs a fork and stabs herself in the hand, then cries out)
Barry:	Oh! That was a little weird.
Vanessa:	I'm talking to a bee.
Barry:	Yeah.
Vanessa:	I'm talking to a bee.
