Optical wireless communication (OWC) can enable much higher data rates (tens of Gbps) compared to traditional
radio frequency or RF-based wirelesstechnologies. A highly useful feature of OWC is its inherentsignalsecurity and
it can also provide connectivity in unfavorable conditions, e.g., presence of RF jamming or interception. Hence,
equipping military robots like PackBots [1] with OWC-enabled transceivers is a potential application area for OWC.
Despite the advantages, the high directionality ofsuch transceivers makesOWC vulnerable to mobility and requires
discovery and maintenance of line-of-sight (LOS) alignment between the transceivers.
In this project, the students will design and develop a multi-transceiver OWC communication module. Mobile robot
cars will be equipped with these OWC modules. The students will also develop protocols for LOS maintenance
between these cars to establish communication links and transfer data. The multi-transceiver OWC module will
not only help in maintaining LOS alignment but can also enable simultaneous communication with multiple robot
cars.
